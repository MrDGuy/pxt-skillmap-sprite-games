# One While loop to complete the tilemap

## Introduction @unplugged

In this tutorial you will create a single while loop to give the robot all the necessary conditions to navigate any pathway to the goalTile.
![While Loop](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MrDGuy/pxt-skillmap-robot-conditional-loops/main/docs/static/while-loop-3.gif "While Loop" )

## Step One

Bring in a ``||robot:begin screen||`` code to start your code.

```python
robot.begin_screen()
```

## Step Two

Now click the ``||loops:loops||`` category from the toolbox and drag in the ``||loops:while||`` code. Make sure your tabbing is correct.

```python
robot.begin_screen()
while True:
    pass
```

## Step Three

Delete the True next to the while and drag in a ``||robot:goal reached||``.

```python
robot.begin_screen()
robot.turn_right()
robot.move_forward()
while robot.goal_reached():
    pass
```

## Step Four

After the ``||robot:goal reached||`` code write == False.  Notice that there are TWO EQUALS SIGNS. Make sure that the F is capitalized in False.

```python
robot.begin_screen()
robot.turn_right()
robot.move_forward()
while robot.goal_reached() == False:
    pass
```

## Step Five

Delete the pass. Click in the ``||logic:logic||`` category and drag in the ``||logic:if||`` inside the while loop where the pass had been.

```python
robot.begin_screen()
while robot.goal_reached() == False:
    if True:
        pass
```

## Step Six

Delete the True next to the if.  Click and drag in a ``||robot:can move||`` code to the where the True had been. Make sure that the colon is still there.

```python
robot.begin_screen()
while robot.goal_reached() == False:
    if robot.can_move(""):
        pass
```

## Step Seven

The "" inside the parethenses is the direction you want to check if the robot can move.  The options are forward, backward, left, and right.  ALL LOWERCASE! Type right inside the quotation marks.

```python
robot.begin_screen()
while robot.goal_reached() == False:
    if robot.can_move("right"):
        pass
```

## Step Eight

Delete the pass and make sure you write the code exactly where the pass had been.  Drag in a ``||robot:turn right||`` code where the pass had been.

```python
robot.begin_screen()
while robot.goal_reached() == False:
    if robot.can_move("right"):
        robot.turn_right()
```

## Step Nine

Next drag  in an ``||logic:if||`` code to where line 8 inside the loop but not tabbed twice so it is outside of the if robot.can_move("right"):

```python
robot.begin_screen()
while robot.goal_reached() == False:
    if robot.can_move("right"):
        robot.turn_right()
    if True:
        pass
```

## Step Ten

Delete the True next to the if.  Click and drag in a ``||robot:can move||`` code to the where the True had been. Make sure that the colon is still there.

```python
robot.begin_screen()
while robot.goal_reached() == False:
    if robot.can_move("right"):
        robot.turn_right()
    if robot.can_move(""):
        pass
```

## Step Eleven

Write left inside the quotations for the second if statement. Include a ``||robot:turn left||`` instead of the pass. 

```python
robot.begin_screen()
while robot.goal_reached() == False:
    if robot.can_move("right"):
        robot.turn_right()
    if robot.can_move("left"):
        robot.turn_left()
```

## Step Twelve

Next drag  in an ``||logic:if else||`` code to where line 8 inside the loop but not tabbed twice so it is outside of the if robot.can_move("left"):

```python
robot.begin_screen()
while robot.goal_reached() == False:
    if robot.can_move("right"):
        robot.turn_right()
    if robot.can_move("left"):
        robot.turn_left()
    if True:
        pass
    else:
        pass
```

## Step Thirteen

Delete the True next to the if.  Click and drag in a ``||robot:can move||`` code to the where the True had been. Make sure that the colon is still there.

```python
robot.begin_screen()
while robot.goal_reached() == False:
    if robot.can_move("right"):
        robot.turn_right()
    if robot.can_move("left"):
        robot.turn_left()
    if robot.can_move(""):
        pass
    else:
        pass
```

## Step Fourteen

Write forward inside the quotations for the second if statement. Include a ``||robot:move forward||`` instead of the pass.  

```python
robot.begin_screen()
while robot.goal_reached() == False:
    if robot.can_move("right"):
        robot.turn_right()
    if robot.can_move("left"):
        robot.turn_left()
    if robot.can_move("forward"):
        robot.move_forward()
    else:
        pass
```

## Step Fourteen

In the else, write ``||robot: turn_left||`` two times to turn the robot around.  This is the case when the robot is blocked from the front, left and right so it needs to turn back.  Run your code a watch the robot navigate on it's own.

```python
robot.begin_screen()
while robot.goal_reached() == False:
    if robot.can_move("right"):
        robot.turn_right()
    if robot.can_move("left"):
        robot.turn_left()
    if robot.can_move("forward"):
        robot.move_forward()
    else:
        robot.turn_left()
        robot.turn_left()
```
